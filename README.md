# three-go
## A Stripped-Down ThreeJS Boilerplate
### (intended for rapid prototyping and quick single page experiments)

![alt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelHazani/three-go/master/scr.png)

## Features:

- a babelified, watchified, live-reloaded ES6 / module-based workflow 
- a bash script to do some menial labor and redefine the project as your own
- Orbitcontrols and a cube
- That's it. The idea is to keep fluff to a minimum.

## Installation: 

- clone this repo
- *Either* run ". threego.sh" (to source the bash file locally) and follow the onscreen instructions; script will also automatically "npm start" (see below)
- *OR*:
    - make any file/folder name modifications manually
    - npm install (browsersync may have to be installed golbally)
    - "npm start" launches two scripts: [watchify](https://github.com/substack/watchify) and [browser-sync](https://github.com/BrowserSync/browser-sync).

### Now go make things.
